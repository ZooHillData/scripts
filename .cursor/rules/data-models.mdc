Key Data Structures:

1. Script Collection Organization
- Two-level hierarchical structure for script storage
- Maximum directory depth: 2 levels
- Root scripts categorized under "root" label
- Subdirectory names serve as category identifiers

2. Script Installation Status Model
- Binary state tracking (installed/uninstalled)
- Installation status determined by alias presence in .zshrc
- Reference mapping between script paths and shell aliases

3. Script Reference Model
- Absolute paths used for script references
- Base names (without extensions) used for alias generation
- Directory structure preserved in alias path mapping

4. Script Categories
- Directory-based categorization
- Root level: "root" category
- Level 1: Named by containing directory
- Level 2: Named by subdirectory

Importance Score: 85
Rationale: Core data organization model that enables script discovery, categorization and status tracking
