# data-models

Script Collection Model:
- Two-level hierarchical organization of shell scripts within repository
- Directory-based grouping for organizational purposes
- Special exclusion rules for utility scripts (e.g., "add-to-rc.bash")

Installation Status Model:
- Binary state tracking (installed/uninstalled) based on alias presence
- Managed section markers in RC files define installation boundaries
- Reference system using begin/end delimiters ("=== BEGIN/END: Script Management System Aliases ===")

Script Reference Structure:
- Flat alias namespace derived from script hierarchy
- Script-to-alias mapping preserves original repository structure
- Extension stripping (.bash) for clean alias names

Managed Section Model:
- Isolated block within RC files for automated management
- Single source of truth enforcement for alias definitions
- Conflict detection for duplicate alias declarations

Importance Score: 95
Rationale: Core data model defining script organization, reference system, and state tracking that directly enables the primary business functionality
