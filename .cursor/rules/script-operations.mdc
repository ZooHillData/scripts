## Core Script Management System
Importance Score: 85

The script management system implements hierarchical organization and installation tracking of shell scripts within a repository structure:

1. Installation Status Tracking
- Determines script installation state by verifying alias presence in .zshrc
- Maintains distinction between installed/uninstalled scripts
- Implements configurable visibility of uninstalled scripts via --include-uninstalled flag

2. Hierarchical Organization
- Groups scripts by directory location up to 2 levels deep
- Root-level scripts receive "root" category designation
- Enforces maximum directory depth constraint

## Shell Environment Integration
Importance Score: 90

Automated shell environment configuration system:

1. Alias Generation Logic
- Creates unique shell aliases for discovered .sh scripts
- Preserves script directory structure in alias paths
- Uses script base names (without extensions) as alias commands
- Excludes add-to-rc.sh from alias creation process

2. Installation Management Rules  
- Maintains alias uniqueness through duplicate detection
- Uses absolute paths for location-independent script execution
- Implements idempotent alias registration
- Limits script discovery to repository depth of 2 directories
