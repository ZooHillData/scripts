## Core Script Management System (Importance: 95)

The script management system implements business-critical operations for managing shell aliases through two key components:

1. Script Installation Status Checker (`script-manager/get-scripts.bash`)
- Enforces organizational policy through selective script filtering
- Reports script installation state through .zshrc alias verification 
- Groups scripts by directory for hierarchical organization
- Provides configurable visibility policies for installed/uninstalled scripts

2. Script Registration System (`add-to-rc.bash`)
- Creates managed sections in RC files with explicit boundary markers
- Implements single-source-of-truth policy for alias definitions
- Enforces script discovery within 2-level depth hierarchy
- Maintains alias namespace isolation through extension stripping

## Business Rules (Importance: 85)

1. Script Filtering:
- Excludes utility scripts ("add-to-rc.bash") from processing
- Limits script discovery to .bash extension
- Maintains 2-level directory depth restriction

2. Installation Status:
- Determines through presence of alias definitions
- Groups by directory structure
- Configurable display of uninstalled scripts

3. Alias Management:
- Preserves existing alias definitions
- Warns about duplicates
- Maintains clear section boundaries
- Requires shell restart notification

## Domain Model (Importance: 90)

The system implements a specialized domain model for script management:

1. Managed Section Concept
- Explicit begin/end markers
- Automated management boundaries
- Change isolation policy

2. Script-to-Alias Mapping
- Repository structure preservation
- Flat alias namespace
- Extension stripping convention

3. Installation Status Model
- Binary installed/uninstalled state
- Directory-based grouping
- Configurable visibility rules
