# main-overview

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system consists of two primary business components that manage shell script organization and accessibility:

## Script Management System (Importance: 85)
Core logic for script discovery and status tracking:
- Differentiates installed vs uninstalled scripts through .zshrc alias verification 
- Implements hierarchical categorization based on directory structure
- Enforces 2-level directory depth limit for script organization
- Provides selective visibility of uninstalled scripts via filtering

## Shell Environment Manager (Importance: 80)
Handles script availability and alias management:
- Creates unique shell aliases for repository scripts
- Maintains alias consistency through collision detection
- Preserves script hierarchy in command naming
- Ensures repository-wide script accessibility through absolute paths

## Integration Points (Importance: 75)
The components work together to:
- Track script installation status across the repository
- Maintain organized script categories based on location
- Provide consistent access through standardized aliases
- Prevent duplicate/conflicting command definitions

Key paths:
- script-manager/get-scripts.bash: Script inventory and status tracking
- add-to-rc.bash: Shell environment configuration and alias management
